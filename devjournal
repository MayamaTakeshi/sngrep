This is an attempt to implement support for MRCP following 
  https://github.com/irontec/sngrep/issues/254

I did the necessary changes to process MRCP packets and save them in an RTP stream.
(commit 569773b1c1cce5bb3cdd30d98e142c8e5678e392)
What is missing at this point is the update of the UI.
But the app works normally at this point and shows rtp streams properly (so no change in behavior. But I added some strdup and didn't add the necessary calls to 'free' yet).


However I when I was working on the ui part, I realized MRCP should not be handled as and RTP stream as all messages would be bundled in a single arrow.
Instead I want each MRCP message to be visible as a SIP message and be able to click on them and show the full payload.
So I'm abandoning this approach will try another one.
